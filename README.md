My solutions to the 2022's edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Special Challenge
I'll try to solve the problems using only "one line" of javascript code, meaning no semicolon nor space return allowed.

After struggling with some of the harder challenges, I'll allow myself to use window variables (but they can't be set beforehand).

This code is not made to be proper nor human readable, but mostly a fun challenge for me. Don't expect it to be performant or beautiful!
